                    <p>
                        <br>
                        Tuesday, August 29, 2017
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Today is offically  my last day of summer and I say "vacation" because this summer has been everything but a vacation. Although it wasn't a vacation, it was a 
                        summer where I got to experience corporate America through my first internship. Yay! It was a totally new experience and I was feeling both excited and nevrous, 
                        the feeling was almost like how I felt on the first day of college. I was an IT intern at a company called Air Liquide and I know that you're attempting to pronounce
                        "Liquide" right now. It's actually pronouced Luh-keed because Air Liquide is a French company. When I first read the name, I just called it Air Liquid and almost all the other interns 
                        did the same. I met so many cool people and learned so much during my 10 weeks that I could go on and on about my time there, so I'll just talk about some of the most 
                        important things I learned. I really had no idea how corporate would be. The first two weeks of my internship were basically just transitioning and getting used to the 
                        environment. The cubicles surpised me because I always imagined them to be pretty basic, but the ones are Air Liquide had ergonmic desks, dual monitors, and tons of room
                        to put your belongings. I think just getting to experience corporate gives me a sneak peek into life after university and I won't have to take as long to get acustomed to it
                        in the future. I think the most important thing I've learned at Air Liquide is about communication. Even though I worked in the IT department and dealt with technical stuff, I really got to experience
                        and understand the importance of meetings and everyone being on the same page during projects. A small misunderstanding in this envirionment could cause a load of trouble 
                        and push back dates. I had to work with multiple telecom providers and also solve problems for other Air Liquide sites, so I got to understand the business as both
                        a customer and assiting customers. Towards the end of my internship, all the interns had to do final presentations to some high ranking managers and directors. I 
                        was freaking out before the presentation because, to me, it was my first "big" professional presentation and it had to be in front of the big dogs. Everyone kept 
                        telling me to relax because they are all just normal people like me, and that was something I really understood after the presentation. Once I met them all, that's 
                        when I noticed they are all down-to-earth and really easy to talk to. I really valued the final presentation because there are constant presentations in corporate 
                        and I don't get many chances to present to that sort of audience much at school. Working at Air Liqude has actually made me excited to start school tomorrow because I'll be
                        able to put everything I've learned to improve my time at UT. I'm going to end it here and get some rest before classes begin tomorrow. Til next time everyone!
